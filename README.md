# Numerical Simulations – King’s College London

This repo showcases simulation projects completed as part of my numerical methods coursework. Projects explore mathematical modeling, algorithm design, and problem-solving using Python.

## Projects
### Tacoma Bridge Oscillation
A simple model exploring resonance and mechanical instability using differential equations.

### Travelling Salesman Problem
An optimization problem solved using heuristics and visualized using Python's `matplotlib`.

Each project includes source code, explanations, and outputs.
